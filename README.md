# Advanced_DataMining_Project_Up
## Project Overview
This repository contains all the code and analyses for an advanced data mining project aimed at exploring and predicting banking subscription outcomes. The project utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes customer information from a bank's marketing campaign. Attributes include age, job, marital status, education, and many more, totaling 21 different features.

## Techniques and Tools Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, one-hot encoding, feature scaling.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest.
- **Clustering:** K-means for exploratory data analysis.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Visualization:** Scatter plots, PairGrids.
